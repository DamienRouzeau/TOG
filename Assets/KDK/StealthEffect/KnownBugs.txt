Sci-Fi Stealth Effect by Marc Sureda 2017

Known bugs (v1.2):

-Scene viewport sometimes does not render the opacity right. Should be OK in the game scene.
-Due to scale issues, you might need to tweak the "Stealth Scale" parameter in the material inspector
if the effect does not cover your mesh entirely.
-If the effect is showing left-right instead of top-bottom, check your meshes' Y-up/Z-up while exporting.
-Please check your tangents if you are generating procedural meshes and the material shows black.
