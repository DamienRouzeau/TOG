If you will not need demo scenes anymore, you cam remove folders like:

Assets/FImpossible Creations/Optimizers/DEMO - Optimizers  
(Here are demo scenes and demo script examples also demo models and prefabs)

Assets/FImpossible Creations/FBasic Assets/Behaviours
Assets/FImpossible Creations/FBasic Assets/FHelpers
Assets/FImpossible Creations/FBasic Assets/Scripts
(From here you will remove different scripts used in demo scenes but leave shared utility ones needed for Optimizers to work)
Then package would have ~3.5mb weight

Description:

Cull, deactivate and activate if visible, adjust quality basing on distance (LOD) on anything inside the scene of your project!
You can give your project more FPS which can give you possibility to make your scenes more detailed!

Use it for simple optimization, like deactivating only when target object is far away, or use for much more complex
stuff like many LOD levels, fading between levels, using different settings on certain levels for many components at the same time,
switch settings / Cull when object is behind wall or camera looking away.

Optimizers can optimize almost everything, things like Lights, Particle Systems, Terrains, Renderers and much more.
Package also brings components with which you can cull or L.O.D. your script components! (very useful for example for foot IK scripts)

This system is ussing Unity's CullingGroup api and other smart techniques to keep optimization logics in the most performent way.
Optimize static and dynamic objects, Optimizers manager will intelligentlyand progressively adapt to your game performance and work with thread to
not still any fps from your project only give a lot of them!
With easy to use Optimizers' custom inspector window you will set up your culling settings without need to know much about optimizing.

Changelog:

V1.0.3
- Important Change: Now "Deactivate Object" is untoggled by default, deactivating and activating whole game objects in many cases was causing performance peaks during culling object if it wasn't in camera view (if you rotated camera)
- Added "Auto" button next to "Max Distance" it will help you define max distance for object, basing on camera's far plane settings, and size of detection sphere
- Automatic detection shapes dimensions now will fit better to scaled objects
- Dynamic optimization method shape now scales with object
- Warning and explanation of "Deactivate Object" toggle
- Warning message when you copy not prefabed objects and without shared settings with optimizers to another scene (LOD Sets will be lost - because they're managed by unity as scene assets, not gameObject serialized data)

V1.0.2
- Important Change: Implemented CullingContainers logics which are significantly boosting performance for culling detection calculations for tones of objects if they're using same count of LOD levels and same distance values - for 'static' and 'effective' methods (if you were using more than 1000 optimizers you should notice difference, also now you can freely use like 100 000 optimizers at the same time! )
- Added possibility to attach transforms to detection spheres in Complex Shape Optimizer component 
IMPORTANT: If you were using complex shape component, select it in project or game view to let component convert previous spheres to new system
- Disabling optimizer is now fully supported [optimizer.enabled = false] (probably you will not need this but some projects could make use of it)
- Static Game Object automatic detection for "Static" optimization method + dialog
- Now light optimizer "Render Mode" enums will have same names like ones inside Light component's inspector window
- Changed drawing for multipliers in light and particle systems LOD settings from 0-1 to 0%-100% ("FPD_Percentage()" instead of "Range()")
- Added helper buttons to sync camera's clipping planes or scene fog settings with render range etc. inside optimizers manager
- Small bug fixes

V1.0.1.3
- Fixed transform scale detection sphere radius preview in scene view during editor mode
- Light transitioning fixes when not using ("change intensity")

V1.0.1.2
- Added toggle in first LOD level window to unlock disabling and editing parameters (experimental)
- Now disabling optimizer component during playmode will prevent changes on optimized objects

V1.0.1.1
- When using nested prefabs (parent object having optimizer and child objects having optimizers) optimizer will not try
adding component onto "To Optimize" list when the same component is in use by other, child optimizer component.
- Added LOG warning about creating optimizer inside prefab mode - it's not yet supported

V1.0.1
- Improved compatibility with Unity 2019
- Added component Optimizer Cleaner to remove unused sub-assets from prefabs generated because of issue with Unity 2019
- Many small changes improving integration
- Entry integration for Asset Pipeline V2
