Thank you for purchasing PBR Desert pack!


In order to replicate the look of the screenshots and videos please do the following:

Download the post processing from the package manager and add a post processing layer and volume component to your camera.

There is a camera profile (Materials_shaders) that you can add to your camera (add a post pcrocess behavior component), all the effects are already set up for you.

The cloth and vegetation shader is customisable.

The trees/vegetation prefabs are using unity's terrain system and are already set-up for you.

All the prefabs are setup with lods.


Enjoy,
Red Panda.
